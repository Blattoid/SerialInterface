# Serial Interface

This utility allows you to read and write serial data to and from a COM port. You can select a port to communicate with and specify the baud rate. That's pretty much it.
If you are unsure about what baud rate to select, open a Command Prompt and use the 'mode' command to get the settings needed for every port.
